To resolve the game asset loading issue:

1. The character model path has been updated to use a public assets folder
2. Create the directory structure /public/assets/ and place your character.glb file there
3. The loader error handling has been fixed in Game.tsx

Additional steps required:
1. Place your character.glb file in the Ups_and_Downs-React_client/public/assets/ directory
2. Make sure the character.glb file is properly formatted and not corrupted
3. You may need to run `npm run build` to ensure the assets are properly processed

The error "SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'd', "data:model"... is not valid JSON" occurred because the system was trying to parse the model file as JSON. This has been fixed by:
1. Using the correct path to the GLB file
2. Ensuring the GLB loader is properly handling the binary format
3. Adding proper error handling for the loader
