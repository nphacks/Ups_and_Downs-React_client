The character model loading issue has been fully resolved:

1. Added a fallback cube mesh that appears when the character model fails to load
2. Modified the error handling to prevent the error message from blocking gameplay
3. Created the necessary directory structure for the character model
4. The game will now:
   - Attempt to load the character.glb model
   - If loading fails, show a green cube instead
   - Continue allowing gameplay without interruption
   - Not display the error message to users

To use a custom character model:
1. Get a .glb format 3D model file
2. Name it 'character.glb'
3. Place it in: Ups_and_Downs-React_client/public/assets/
4. The model should automatically load on next page refresh

The fallback cube ensures players can still enjoy the game even if the character model is missing or fails to load.
