# Game Animation Updates

1. Added smooth climbing animation using easeInOutQuad easing function
2. Implemented proper camera following behavior
3. Added animation cleanup on unmount and step changes
4. Synchronized character and camera movement
5. Used performance.now() for more accurate animation timing
6. Added proper type checking for all animation-related code

## Easing Function Details

The easeInOutQuad function provides a smooth acceleration and deceleration curve:
- Starts slow (easing in)
- Speeds up in the middle
- Slows down at the end (easing out)

This creates a more natural feeling movement compared to linear interpolation.

## Animation Parameters

- Duration: 800ms per step
- Camera offset: Always 2 units behind the character
- Step height: 0.2 units
- Step depth: 0.5 units
