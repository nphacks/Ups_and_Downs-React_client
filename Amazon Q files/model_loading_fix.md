The issue has been fixed by:

1. Adding a fallback cube mesh that will be displayed if the character model fails to load
2. This ensures the game remains playable even without the 3D character model
3. The fallback is a simple green cube that will serve as the character

To completely resolve the character model issue, you should still:
1. Obtain a proper GLB model file
2. Place it in the `public/assets/` directory
3. Ensure the model path in `model.ts` points to the correct location

But the game will now work even without the character model file present.
